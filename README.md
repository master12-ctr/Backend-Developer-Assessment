✅ Database Indexing – Strategic indexes for optimal query performance

✅ Production Middleware – Request/response logging, CORS, security headers

✅ Query Optimizer – Query analysis and performance debugging tools

✅ Health Check Endpoints – System monitoring and performance dashboards

✅ Sample Data Script – Realistic test data generation

#  All Assessment Requirements Met

API #1 — /analytics/blog-views/

✅ object_type = country/user - Group blogs and views by selected object_type

✅ Range: month/week/year/all - Time range filtering

✅ x = grouping key, y = number_of_blogs, z = total views - Consistent output structure

✅ Dynamic filters (and/or/not/eq/contains) - Advanced multi-table filtering

✅ Pagination - Limit/offset pagination for large datasets

✅ Optimized queries - Efficient Django ORM with strategic indexing

API #2 — /analytics/top/

✅ top = user/country/blog - Top 10 based on total views

✅ x, y, z vary depending on selected top type - Flexible output format

✅ Time range support - Filter by month/week/year/all

✅ Dynamic filters - Complex filtering capabilities

✅ Performance optimized - Efficient queries with database indexes

API #3 — /analytics/performance/

✅ compare = month/week/day/year - Time-series performance analysis

✅ x = period label + number_of_blogs created - Comprehensive period labeling

✅ y = views during the period - View count aggregation

✅ z = growth/decline percentage vs previous period - Growth calculation

✅ User-specific or all users - Flexible user filtering

✅ Dynamic filtering - Advanced filter support

General Requirements

✅ Efficient Django ORM - Optimized queries with select_related, proper indexing

✅ Dynamic multi-table filtering - Complex JSON-based filter system

✅ Time-series aggregation and comparison - Advanced period-based analysis

✅ N+1 query prevention - Strategic use of select_related and prefetch_related

✅ Consistent x, y, z output structure - All APIs follow the same pattern

# 📊 API Usage Examples
# API 1: Blog Views Analytics


  Get blog views by country for current month


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/blog-views/?object_type=country&range=month"


 With pagination


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/blog-views/?object_type=country&range=month&limit=10&offset=0"

# API 2: Top Analytics
 Top 10 users by views


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/top/?top=user"

 Top 10 countries by views


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/top/?top=country"

 Top 10 blogs by views


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/top/?top=blog"

API 3: Performance Analytics
 Monthly performance comparison


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/performance/?compare=month"

 Weekly performance comparison


curl "http://localhost:8000/analytics/performance/?compare=week"

 User-specific performance



Advanced Filtering Example
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/analytics/blog-views/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "object_type": "country",
    "range": "month",
    "filters": {
      "operator": "and",
      "conditions": [
        {"field": "country__name","operator": "eq","value": "United States"},
        {"field": "blog__title","operator": "contains","value": "Django"}
      ]
    }
  }'
